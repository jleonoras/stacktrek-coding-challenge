    <h2>Trees<br/></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>I think that I shall never see<br/></p>
    <p>A poem lovely as a tree.<br/></p>
    <br/>
    <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br/></p>
    <p>the earth&#39;s sweet flowing breast;<br/></p>
    <br/> 
    <p>A tree that looks at God all day,<br/></p>
    <p>lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br/></p>
    <br/> 
    <p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br/></p>
    <p>A nest of robins in her hair;<br/></p>
    <br/> 
    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br/></p>
    <p>Who intimately lives with rain.<br/></p>
    <br/> 
    <p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br/></p>
    <p>But only God can make a tree.<br/></p>
